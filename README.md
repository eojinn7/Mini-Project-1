CaesarCipher.java:
Implements the caesar cipher to a word, either encoding or decoding depending on the command line argument. Shifts each letter in the string down the order of the alphabet, for every possible combination, which is 26 (0 to 25) as there are 26 letters in the alphabet for it to shift down. Prints all possible combination (shifts).

VigenereCipher.java
Implements the vigenere cipher, either encoding or decoding by adding the integer values of each corresponding letter in the two strings, plaintext and the keyword. Assures that the length of the plaintext and the keyword are the same by replicating the keyword until it fits the length of the plaintext. Prints the encoded/decoded string on command line.
